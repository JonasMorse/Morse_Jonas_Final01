**TITLE:  StillWater RPG** 

**Description** 

StillWater RPG is a text-based fantasy role-playing game inspired by a book I have been working on titled \*StillWater\*. The game will allow players to explore different choices, featuring a party system with a recruitable npc, and interactive storytelling through dialogue, stats management, and branching paths integrating with a character creator and abilities that actually do different things.

1. Debugging function arguments and game flow errors, such as missing parameters in player methods.
