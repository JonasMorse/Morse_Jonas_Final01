TITLE:  StillWater RPG


Description
StillWater RPG is a text-based fantasy role-playing game inspired by a book I have been working on titled *StillWater*. The game will allow players to explore different choices, featuring a party system with a recruitable npc, and interactive storytelling through dialogue, stats management, and branching paths integrating with a character creator and abilities that actually do different things.

 Features

Character Creator
Party System

Branching story
Full combat system

Challenges

Making a real playable story that you can both win and lose.
The art itself will all be hand done
Debugging function arguments and game flow errors, such as missing parameters in player methods.
